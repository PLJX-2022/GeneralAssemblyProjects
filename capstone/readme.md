# <u><b>Capstone:</b></u> Recommending adjacent jobs to platfrom delivery drivers using NLP and consine similarity

With the recent proliferation of online e-commerce platforms, like Lazada and Shopee, and tech companies like Go-JEK and Deliveroo, providing last-mile delivery services, it is not surprising that we also saw an explosion of jobseekers turning to platform delivery work as a career option, especially amongst the young. These individuals are enticed by, 
- the low barriers to entry, 
- the perceived flexible working hours,
- being able to be their own boss, 
- as well as the much publicised claims of being able to earn more than $8K/month if one is able to grind.

However, a recent study by NUS titled “In-work poverty and the challenges of getting by among the young”, highlights the harsh realities of such work. Amongst those surveyed, the study found that most 
- worked long hours at 44hrs/week which is higher than the 35hrs/week of a full time job
- earned a median income of about $2K
- and 38% of them have had at least 1 accident in the past year 

There is also little room for career / income growth. As independent contractors rather than employees, these delivery workers are also not eligible to employer CPF contributions and not required to contribute to their own CPF as well which may lead them to be unprepared for retirement. 

Therefore, this got me interested to find out if there are other viable career options, delivery workers can consider that require similar skillsets as their current job, pays minimally as much, with employers looking to hire.
